# End-to-End Testing

# Overview
End-to-end (E2E) testing is a methodology that tests the entire application flow from start to finish. It validates that all integrated components work together as expected in a production-like environment.

# Purpose
- Verify complete user workflows
- Test system integration points
- Validate data flow across all layers
- Ensure application meets business requirements

# Key Benefits
- **Real-world validation**: Tests the application as users would interact with it
- **Integration coverage**: Catches issues between different system components
- **Confidence**: Provides assurance that the entire system works correctly

# Common Tools
- **Cypress**: Modern web testing framework
- **Playwright**: Cross-browser automation
- **Selenium**: Web application testing
- **Puppeteer**: Chrome/Chromium automation

# Best Practices
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use page object patterns for maintainability
- Focus on critical user journeys
- Run tests in CI/CD pipelines
- Maintain test data properly

# Getting Started
1. Identify critical user flows
2. Choose appropriate testing framework
